## Description
This application was made to build a better understanding on Apollo Server and GraphQL. This application was originally using a RESTful API and has been refatored into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The application allows a user to search for books, create an account and save books to a personal list of books. The user is free to sign out and return when they like and their books be right where they left them. Changes made to the backend of this application include: Updating the auth middleware inside auth.js to function with GraphQL, implementing the Apollo Server in server.js, create a schema directory with index.js, creating a resolvers.js that defined queries and mutations, as well as a typeDefs.js defining the Query and Mutation types. Changes made to the front end of the application include: creating a queries.js to hold the functionality to get a users profile and books, mutations.js which executed the functions found in the API.js file. updated App.js with a Apollo Provider, make changes to SearchBooks.js to use the Apollo Hooks, SavedBooks.js updated to use Query hooks and mutation hooks. In SignupForm.js and LoginForm.js replaced the API functions with mutation functionality.
